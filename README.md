# elm-polymer-calendar

This demonstrates how to incorporate a Polymer web component into an Elm application.
In particular, it uses a `polymer-paper-date-picker` component from https://github.com/bendavis78/paper-date-picker to present a calendar and update the Elm model based on the user's choices of calendar date.

## Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:fredcy/elm-polymer-calendar.git
cd elm-polymer-calendar
bower install
make
```

## Serving
```
cd elm-polymer-calendar
python3 -m http.server
```

Browse http://localhost:8000/
